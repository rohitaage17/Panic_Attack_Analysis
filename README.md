### Problem Statement :
The objective of this project is to create a Panic Attack Monitoring Dashboard in Power BI for healthcare professionals and researchers. The dashboard provides insights into panic attack frequency, triggers, demographics, and treatment effectiveness, helping in early detection and patient care improvement.

Possible KPIs include (but are not limited to):

- Total Number of Panic Attacks
- Panic Attack Frequency by Patient / Month
- Average Panic Attack Duration
- Most Common Triggers (Stress, Caffeine, Lack of Sleep, etc.)
- Panic Attack Severity (Average Intensity Score)
- Panic Attack Distribution by Age & Gender
- Panic Attacks During Treatment vs. Before Treatment
- % of Patients with Reduced Episodes after Therapy
- Medication vs. Non-Medication Effectiveness

### Datasource :

The dataset used for this analysis contains patient-reported panic attack events, demographics, and treatment details.

- Dataset: Panic Attack Event Data
- Rows: ~5,000 observations
- Columns: ~20 attributes (Patient ID, Age, Gender, Date, Time, Trigger, Severity, Duration, Treatment Status, etc.)

### Data Preparation :

Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power Query:

- Removed duplicate patient event records
- Standardized categorical values (Yes/No, Trigger categories)
- Validated correct data types (numeric for duration, categorical for triggers, datetime for event timestamps)
- Created calculated fields for Attack Frequency, Severity Index, and Improvement %

## Data Analysis (DAX):
  
Measures used in  all visualization are:
 
% Patients Dizziness = `DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER('panic_attack_dataset',panic_attack_dataset[Dizziness]=TRUE())),COUNTROWS('panic_attack_dataset'),0) *100`
Age group Switch = `SWITCH(TRUE(),'panic_attack_dataset'[Age]<=17, "Child", panic_attack_dataset[Age]<=24,"Adolescent",panic_attack_dataset[Age]<=64,"Adult","Senior")`

## Data Visualization (Dashboard) :

Data visualization for the data analysis (DAX) was done in Microsoft Power BI Desktop:

## Insights :

From the analysis, the following can be observed:
  
- Panic attacks are most common in the 20â€“35 age group.
- Stress and lack of sleep are the top triggers.
- Patients undergoing therapy show an average 40% reduction in episodes after 3 months.
- Women reported slightly higher severity scores compared to men.
- Panic attacks are more frequent during weekdays than weekends, possibly due to work-related stress
